Demo 3 Notes

Note 1: The current location button works but there's a delay. You may have to click multiple times or click on it and then click somewhere on the mouse for it to update to your currrent location

Note 2: The Reset Button resets the polyline location history but it does not put the coins back

Note 3: The sensor thing, I don't think it works?? But it might... Due to the delay with current location I can't tell???

Note 4: Persistent data storage does not work
